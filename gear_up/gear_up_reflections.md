1. What were your reflections from the video?
* **I've heard of "inherent bias" before this, and also have first hand experience**
  **as a result of my own unconscious attitude towards individuals when I would either**
  **interview them for a position, greet someone, or just people watch.**
<br></br>
* **Everyone has it. Even the most positive of individuals has some attitude**
  **towards someone they just met, be it positive or negative.**
<br></br>
<br></br>
2. In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?
* **Many times I've met someone and just not liked them. However, when I find myself**
  **internally discriminating over this individual (for no good reason), I've recently asked myself "Why?".**
<br></br>
* **What did they do to me??? Nothing. So, why am I pre-judging?**
<br></br>
* **When I find myself in these situations, I reflect on if anyone has thought this**
  **way about me, and how it could have affected my opportunities.**
<br></br>
* **Now, when I meet someone, I listen and get to know them, because the one you**
  **push away could be the one you need.**
<br></br>
<br></br>
3. What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?
* **Wow, what a question...I haven't even thought about specifics like that, but**
  **when I do get into a technical profession, I know that I'll have to analyze the type of**
  **person who will use it. And, I will have to look at a lot of different factors**
  **to see who this would be beneficial for.**
