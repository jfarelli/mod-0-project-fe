## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* From the article, I like the **SMART** (Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) acronym in setting up achievable goals in your work. Often I'll just grind with no (real) goal than to just get the work done, but setting up smaller and more specific goals the SMART way, seems like it would garner more success.
* From the video, my biggest takeaway is not comparing yourself to anyone but ***yourself***. Other people are on different paths and learn in different ways; sometimes quicker than you can. As long as you're making progress, you're growing, and you'll get to where you want to be.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* By realizing I'm struggling and not giving up. By searching for the answer (either online, or through my peers) and not getting discouraged, but motivated to find it.
* I have a little of the "Imposter Syndrome" going on, so there are times when I sit around wondering what the hell I'm doing, and as I'm wondering, I'm not making any progress.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
* I liked it, because it had me go back into my notes and find the answer, and then type it into the terminal. It's good for my muscle memory, and I think it benefits everyone as we progress into more and more difficult material.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
* If a condition is met, then your code executes one, or more statements and delivers that result.
* A daily life conditional would be something like if I'm awake, and I have clothes on, then I can go outside. Else, I stay inside.
* Let's say that I'm going to a dispensary website, if I'm over 21 I can view the site, if I'm not, than I cannot.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
* To add multiple conditions, use the else if/else statements.
* The program reads the else if/else statements in order to see if they meet the condition. If the first statement does not, then the computer checks the 2nd, 3rd, etc... until a condition is met.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
* Logical operators && (and), and || (or) are used to check if one, or both conditions are met before running a program.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
* Do developers go as far as to include a subset of if/else if/else statement into a block of if/else if/else statements, or would that just be ridiculous? I don't know if this question even makes sense, but it's the question I have.
