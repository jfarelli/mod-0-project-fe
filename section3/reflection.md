## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
* It helps me learn a lot better when the supports are taken out. I'm more prone to go
through my notes and revisit a lesson if I've forgotten anything.
* Also, it's honing my Google skills and learning how to ask the right questions.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
* Reddit: Listing out the different subreddits, or stories on the home page.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
* Array methods allow you to augment the initial array in your code.
* You can add (push), or remove (pop) variables to the end.
* You can also add (unshift) and remove (shift) from the beginning of an array as well.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
* Loops allow us to run a piece of code repeatedly, until it proves false.
* We would run a loop with an array if we wanted to quickly access the elements in that array.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
* A loop will do something until you tell it to stop doing that thing.
* It will count until it can't count anymore, depending on what you tell it.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
* The question I had going into this portion, was how to write an if/else statement
  within the loop, and get it to work.
* I really struggled with that question when it came up, but after powering through
  (aka: Googling my face off) and coming to the right answer, I feel like I (somewhat) get
  how to do it, and what steps are needed to make it work correctly.
