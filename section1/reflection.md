## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I'm somewhere in-between too long and too short. Sometimes I'll wait to see if someone
else will ask, and sometimes I just spit something out without really running it through
my head to see if I can get to the answer.
It's a battle, but I'm working towards a happy medium the more we go through each session.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
I learned about how number data types are all numbers, including negatives and decimals;
that a string data type is kind of like a part of a sentence wrapped in quotes, often
followed (or proceeded) by var names, or other characters.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log(`"Hello World!"`);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// (two backslashes) signifies a single-line comment
Starting a comment with /* and ending */ is another way to comment out a line of
code, or used for a multi-line comment, if needed.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is like your name. Your name was given to you, and now it's stored
so that you know who you are. But, you can also change your name, so that you
can be called as something else.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Robinhood. The amount of money in your account (number). The names of the stocks
you own (string). If you have enough money in your account to trade, or not (boolean).

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
It brings (adds) together different elements in a string using a plus (+) sign.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
MarcoPolo. When names are strung together in a group video chat.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
What's more prevalent in coding: concatenation, or interpolation. I know interpolation
can be easier to read, so do more developers lean towards that in the industry?
Using concatenation, I find it somewhat frustrating planning out all the spaces
before, or after quotes.
